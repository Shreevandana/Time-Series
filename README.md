# Time-Series

# Dataset
The data for this project (DataSet.xlsx) represents 7 years of monthly data on airline
miles flown in the United Kingdom. 

# Goal 

Developing a forecasting model that can accurately predict the trend for future years.

# Analysis Performed

1. Plotting Time Series data.
2. Computing the autocorrelation function and displaying  it in a plot.
3. Computing a moving average for the data and overlaying on the original time-series plot. 
4. Computing the first difference of the data and plotting the ACF and PACF for the differenced data.
5. Performing a first seasonal difference with the seasonal period.
6. Developing a suitable SARIMA model that can be applied on the time series.
7. Forecasting and analysing the mean squared error.

# Reference

This was done as a project in the Time Series Analysis class (DSC 475, Fall 2019) by Prof. Ajay Anand at the University of Rochester, New York.
